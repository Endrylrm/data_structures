# Data Structures

This repository contains my learning of Data Structures. Currently, it only have the implementation of a LinkedList.

# LinkedList

The implementation of the LinkedList is a Singly linked list, where each Node points only to the Next One.
Currently the implementation supports the following: 

- Adding new node at first position O(1), new node at last position O(N), and new node at a selected position O(N).
- Removing node at first position O(1), remove node at last position O(N), and remove node at selected position O(N).
- Searching by value and by position, both being O(N).
- Clearing is O(N).
