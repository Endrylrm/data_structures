# Data Structures

This repository contains my learning of Data Structures. Currently, it only have the implementation of a Linked List (Singly and Doubly) and a Dynamic Size Stack.

# Singly Linked List

The implementation of the Singly linked list, where each Node points only to the Next One.
Currently the implementation supports the following: 

- Adding new node at first position O(1), new node at last position O(N), new node at middle O(N) and new node at a selected position O(N).
- Removing node at first position O(1), remove node at last position O(N), remove node at middle O(N) and remove node at selected position O(N).
- Searching by value and by position, both being O(N).
- Clearing is O(N).
- Checking if it's a valid position O(N).
- Transforming the data in a String or Array, both being O(N).
- Reversing the list is O(N).
- Traverse the list printing the contents is O(N).

# Doubly Linked List

The implementation of the Doubly linked list, where each Node points to the Next One and the previous one.
Currently the implementation supports the following: 

- Adding new node at first position O(1), new node at last position O(1), new node at middle O(N) and new node at a selected position O(N).
- Removing node at first position O(1), remove node at last position O(1), remove node at middle O(N) and remove node at selected position O(N).
- Searching by value and by position, both being O(N).
- Clearing the list is O(N).
- Checking if it's a valid position O(N).
- Transforming the data in a String or Array, both being O(N).
- Reversing the list is O(N).
- Traverse the list printing the contents is O(N).

# Dynamic Size Stack

The implementation of the Dynamic Size Stack, using a Singly Linked List, the Top Node Points to the last pushed node, where the last in is the first out (LIFO).
Currently the implementation supports the following: 

- Pushing new node at top position of the stack O(1).
- Pop node at top position of the stack O(1).
- Peek node at top position of the stack O(1).
- Searching by value and by position, both being O(N).
- Clearing the stack is O(N).
- Reversing the stack is O(N).
- Transforming the data in a String or Array, both being O(N).
- Traverse the stack printing the contents is O(N).

# Queue

The implementation of a Queue, using a Singly Linked List, the Top Node Points to the last pushed node, where the First in is the first out (FIFO).
Currently the implementation supports the following: 

- Enqueue node at rear position of the queue O(1).
- Dequeue node at front position of the queue O(1).
- Searching by value and by position, both being O(N).
- Clearing the queue is O(N).
- Reversing the list is O(N).
- Transforming the data in a String or Array, both being O(N).
- Traverse the queue printing the contents is O(N).
